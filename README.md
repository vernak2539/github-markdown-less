Github.com's Markdown LESS Port
====================

This LESS source should resemble the CSS used in Github.com's Markdown.

To use with your project replace `.readme` selector with the container of your generated markdown.

Used CSS from [github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css/blob/gh-pages/github-markdown.css) to create the less file
